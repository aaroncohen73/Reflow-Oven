The module "Pillow" (available on PyPi) is required

dumpfont.py:

    Usage: python dumpfont.py <font_name> <font_size> <out_name>

    <font_name> is the name of the TrueType font to generate a bitmap from. For
    example: arial.ttf, times.ttf, etc.

    <font_size> is the size of the font bitmap. For example: 10, 14, 24, etc.

    <out_name> is the name of the output file

    By default, antialiasing will be off and the characters that are generated are
    ascii digits, lowercase and uppercase letters, and punctuation.

    The output file will be in a packed binary format with the data for each
    character in this form:

    <ascii_code> <bitmap_width> <bitmap_height> <bitmap_data>

    Each byte in <bitmap_data> is the value of a single greyscale pixel (0-255).
    <bitmap_data> consists of <bitmap_height> packed rows of these pixels, each
    <bitmap_width> long.

rendertext.py:

    Usage: python rendertext.py <font_name> <font_size> <out_name>

    Arguments are the same as dumpfont.py

    Output file will just be

    <bitmap_width> <bitmap_height> <bitmap_data>

    Which will represent data for a single bitmap containing all of the text
    that was rendered.
